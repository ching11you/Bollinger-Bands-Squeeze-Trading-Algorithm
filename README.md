Fascinated by the increase in financial market volatility since the COVID-19 pandemic—driven by rising inflation, monetary policy shifts, and geopolitical tensions—I became deeply interested in identifying trading opportunities amidst this chaos. My research led me to explore various trading strategies, with a particular focus on those that are both unique and underexplored. This journey introduced me to the Bollinger Bands Squeeze Theory.

The Bollinger Bands Squeeze Theory measures the standard deviation of a security's price over a set period, visualised through upper and lower bands around a moving average. The theory suggests that when volatility contracts in a typically volatile security—causing the bands to tighten—a significant expansion in volatility is likely imminent. As the bands widen, the theory can serve as an effective breakout predictor.  By measuring the width between the bands, I can set a specified threshold to which as the bands expend beyond will trigger a signal. Additionally, incorporating daily price changes into the strategy will enable it predict the security's direction of breakout.

Initially, I explored the strategy using PineScript on TradingView, manually adjusting parameters for different securities through a trial-and-error approach to determine optimal settings. Building on this experience, I transitioned to a more systematic approach using Python. I developed a grid search optimization technique to automate parameter selection, leveraging past experimental data to narrow down the most effective ranges. This evolution enabled comprehensive backtesting, not only revealing the strategy's performance metrics but also automatically identifies the optimal configurations for a wide range of securities.

I hope you find this strategy as compelling and innovative as I do!
